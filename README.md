I am building one of the largest collection of different euro coins collected from free currency circulation.
Each euro coin has:
- a value (1 cent to 2 euro)
- a country (currently 20)
- a year (1999 until today)
- (German coin mints additionally have a single character denoting the minting location)

As of mid 2024, there are 2801 coins, from which i have collected almost 1400 (~50%). 
This Telegram coinbot helps me (and enthusiastic fellows) to identify and catalog new coins. It's perfect for numismatics enthusiasts and casual collectors alike!
